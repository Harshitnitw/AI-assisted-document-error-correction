# AI-assisted-document-error-correction

Use generative AI to suggest correction of OCR or other scanned text using context of human verified error free documents of same genre

We will first convert the docx book into an array of sentences split on the basis of full stop (purnaviram (ред)) in hindi language used here, or new paragraph (\n). Refer to the code [here](https://github.com/Harshitnitw/AI-assisted-document-error-correction/blob/main/python_code_for_converting_a_docx_document_into_an_array_on_the_basis_of_purnaviram_and_new_line_n_paragraph.ipynb)
